As an assitive technology user
I want to be able to activate forms and links with enter key
So that I can navigate in the Web with keyboard only interactions

Scenario 1 - Clicking with enter keyboard presses
Given
    I go to "http://www.google.com.br"
    And I wait for the page to load
    And I wait for 3 seconds
When
    I tab navigate to "Mapas" element
    And I press enter
    And I wait for the page to load
    And I wait for 5 seconds
Then
    I see "Google Maps" title

Scenario 2 - Submiting a form with enter keyboard presses
Given
    I go to "http://www.google.com.br"
    And I wait for the page to load
    And I wait for 3 seconds
When
    I tab navigate to "Pesquisa Google" element
    And I type "watinha"
    And I press enter
    And I wait for the page to load
Then
    And I see "watinha - Pesquisa Google" title
