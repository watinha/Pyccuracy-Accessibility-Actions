As an assistive technology user
I want to be able to fill in google search with watinha
So that I see its suggestions for links

Scenario 1 - Fill google search with watinha and see suggestions
Given
    I go to "http://www.google.com"
    I wait for the page to load
When
    I tab navigate to "Pesquisa Google" element
    And I type "wall"
    And I wait for 3 seconds
Then
    I see that current page contains "<b>walmart</b>"

Scenario 2 - Failing scenario
Given
    I go to "http://www.google.com"
    And I wait for the page to load
    And I wait for 3 seconds
When
    I tab navigate to "Estou com sorte" element
    And I type "wall"
Then
    I see that current page contains "<b>walmart</b>"
