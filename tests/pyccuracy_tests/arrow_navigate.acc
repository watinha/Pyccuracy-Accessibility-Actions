As an assistive technology user
I want to be able to use arrow keys to navigate
So that I can search for information in the DOM of a webpage

Scenario 1 - Trying out to search for information in the webpage
Given
    I go to "http://watinha.com"
    And I wait for the page to load
    And I wait for 5 seconds
When
    I use arrow keys to search for "Willian Massami Watanabe" element
Then
    I see that current page contains "References"
