As an assistive technology user
I want to be able to tab navigate in websites
So that I can look for information in them

Scenario 1 - Trying out the tab navigate action
Given
    I go to "http://watinha.com"
    I wait for the page to load
    I wait for 5 seconds
When
    I tab navigate to "talk" element with 2 key presses
    I tab navigate to "Twitter" element with 1 key presses
    I tab navigate to "watinha.com" element with 1 key presses
    I tab navigate to "Willian" element with 1 key presses
Then
    I see "Interactive Curriculum - Willian Massami Watanabe" title

Scenario 2 - Tab navigation at lazy loading sites
Given
    I go to "http://www.google.com"
    And I wait for the page to load
    And I wait for 3 seconds
When
    I tab navigate to "Web" element
    I tab navigate to "Gmail" element
    I tab navigate to "Fazer login" element
    And I tab navigate to "Estou com sorte" element
Then
    I see that current page contains "Estou com sorte"
